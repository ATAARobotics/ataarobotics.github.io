            <p>ATA Team 16596 is a rookie team comprised of five Grade 8 students and the associations youngest member, who is in Grade 6. Trever Schmitt and Robert Paradis both have experience in the FRC world, but for these two, and the third mentor, Matt Zubot, FTC is a new experience. The team has had a lot of laughs and fun experiences as everyone learns the ropes of the FTC world. The Competitions have been a great opportunity to see our robot come to life and compete against other talented and creative teams.</p>
