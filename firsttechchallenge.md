              FIRST Tech Challenge is FIRST's Program for
              middle-school and high-school students. The Alberta Tech
              Alliance Association organizes three FTC teams for
              students in grades 7 to 9. These teams (Hyperdroids
              10015, Strike Bot 16595, Crazy Artificial Intelligence
              16596, and Uncivilized Mecha Monkeys 23468), compete at
              multiple annual events in Canada for a spot at the World
              Competition in Houston, Texas.

              The 2024 season has been a significant success, with
              10015 taking the win at provincials (earning a spot at
              Worlds), 16595 making it to semi-finals in provincials
              (as well as earing the Judge's Choice award) and 23468
              being 4th alliance captain in the Nii'miis'stii league
              tournament. 10015 also earned the Design award at
              Nii'miis'stii and was runner-up for the Control award at
              provincials.</p>

            Although an older team number, Hyperdroids had a re-boot
            in their 2023 season with all-new students and
            mentors. Many of the team stayed together for 2024,
            continuing their learning and success.

            The theme of pink shirts and gum continued: a googly-eyed
            3-wheeled kiwi-drive robot named "Bubblegum" in 2023 was
            replaced with a larger, squatter "Dubble Bubble" in 2024
            featuring a 4-wheel mecchanum drive base and plenty of
            3D-printed pink parts. The team has learned to work
            together bringing sketches to prototypes to designs, using
            more custom and 3D-printed fabrication this year.

          <p>
            Much of Hyperdroid's success is also due to their calm and
            strategic drive-team backed up by a well-tuned pit crew
            who keep the robot tested, charged and ready to compete.
            An iterative approach to programming controls and
            autonomous has allowed the team to meet a series of
            smaller objectives on their way to a Worlds robot,
            incorporating many control lessons and stategies from the
            previous season.
