    <h1>About</h1>
	<p>The Alberta Tech Alliance Association is a Calgary-based organization that provides STEM opportunities for youth through participation in <i>FIRST</i> Robotics programs. Starting with only one FRC team in 2014, we expanded in 2018 by incorporating a second FRC team to assist in spreading STEM opportunities. In the 2021-2022 season, we <i>forged</i> the two teams to form team FORGE 4421. With 4 <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Teams and 3 <i>FIRST</i> Lego League Teams, we support the largest number of students participating in <i>FIRST</i> Robotics programs in Western Canada.</p>
