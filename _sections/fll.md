    <h1>FLL</h1>
	<p>In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association created its first <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Teams for younger students in grade 7 to 9. Played on a smaller field with smaller robots, the <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge focuses on providing robotics opportunities for younger students than those in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition program. The two teams, Hyper Droid #10015 & StrikeBots #16595, participated in the virtual Alberta Provincial Championship.
