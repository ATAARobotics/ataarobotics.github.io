    <h1>2020 Season Update</h1>
    <p>Our season was off to a wild start, with almost 70 students in our fantastic build space across 5 robotic teams. Our build season was incredible, from robot construction to automation to organization, and we entered competition season with dedicated students and 5 incredible robots. Our first competitions were massive successes. Our 3 FTC Teams won 3 of the 5 Southern Alberta Qualifiers and all participated in the Final Round of the Provincial Event, culminating in FTC Team 10015 earning the title of Event Winner and a spot at FTC World Champtionship. Our 2 FRC Teams competed in Victoria, BC at the Canadian Pacific Regional against over 30 other teams from Canada, the USA, and New Zealand. Team 5015 participated in the event semifinal rounds against the Event Winners, while Team 4334 won the event's Judges Award. 
    <br />However, despite these victories and momentum, the season was rapidly halted by the spread of COVID-19. As <i>FIRST</i> prematurely ended the season and cancelled all events, ATAA has closed their buildspace in cooperation with Alberta Health Services. Nevertheless, we will re-open in the future and continue to inspire and empower students with technology and engineering skills once an opportunity to do so safely arrives.</p>
