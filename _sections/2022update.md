    <h1>2022 Season Update</h1>
    <p>After a challenging two years, the decision was made to merge our <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC) Teams, ATA 4334 and SwatBots 5015, into one team. Our new team is 4421 FORGE Robotics and we have competed in two regional tournaments this year, the Canadian Pacific Regional (Victoria, BC) and the Idaho Regional (Nampa, Idaho). We are pleased to report great success at the Canadian Pacific Regional, with 4421 winning the final match with our alliance partners. We are Houston bound for the FRC Championships taking place in Houston Texas April 21 to 23, 2022. Cheer us on!</p>
