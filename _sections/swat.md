    <h1>SWAT Bots</h1>
	<p>Starting in 2009 as a <i>FIRST</i> Lego League Team based in Airdrie, the SWAT Bots progressed through the <i>FIRST</i> series of programs over time, becoming a <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Team in 2012 and a <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition Team in 2014 as Team 5015. With a history of success and inspiration, SWAT Bots joined the Alberta Tech Alliance Association in 2018 to expand the reach of their program to even more students. With a competitive drive, they had one of their most succesful competition seasons in 2019.</p>
