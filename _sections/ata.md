    <h1>ATA</h1>
	<p>Students on <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Team 4334, Alberta Tech Alliance, strive to actively improve themselves and others by spreading <i>FIRST</i> Robotics ideals and values, both in and out of competition. ATA, founded in 2012, gives students the opportunity to pursue an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. With a team compliment of determined, committed and skilled members, they each work year round to promote personal and general improvement within their team and others. They strongly believe that competition and a consistent "try-again" attitude is what leads to innovation and further understanding.</p>
