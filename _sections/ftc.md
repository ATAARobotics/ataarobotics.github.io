    <h1>FTC</h1>
	<p>In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association created its first <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Teams for younger students in grade 7 to 9. Played on a smaller field with smaller robots, the <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge focuses on providing robotics opportunities for younger students than those in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition program. These teams were comprised of Hyper Droid #10015, StrikeBots #16595 and Crazy Artificial Intelligence #16596. In 2023, a fourth team was added; Uncivilized Mecha Monkeys #23468.
