	<p>In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association created 3 <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Teams for younger students in grade 7 to 9. Played on a smaller field with smaller robots, the <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge focuses on providing robotics opportunities for younger students than those in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition program. The three teams, SWAT Bots Red #10015, SWAT Bots Black #16595, and ATA #16596, will attend their first competitions in late November of this year.</p>
