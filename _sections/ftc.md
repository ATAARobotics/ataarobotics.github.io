        In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association created its first <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge Teams for younger students in grades 7 to 9. Played on a 12 by 12ft field with smaller robots, the <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge focuses on providing robotics opportunities for younger students than those in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition program. Currently, our FTC teams are HyperDroid #10015, Crazy Artificial Intelligence #16596, Uncivilized Mecha Monkeys #23468 and Tech Titans #23684.
