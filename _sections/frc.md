    <h1>FRC</h1>
	<p>Students on our <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Team 4421, Forge Robotics, strive to actively improve themselves and others by embodying the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics ideals and values, both in and out of competition. Our team gives students the opportunity to pursue multifaceted and thorough interests in science, technology, engineering, and math all year round. With a team composed of determined, committed and skilled members, every member works to promote personal and general improvement within their team and others. They strongly believe that competition and a consistent "try-again" attitude is what ultimately leads to innovation and further understanding.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past few seasons, our team has achieved remarkable success. In the 2023 season, we ranked among the top 22% of teams worldwide, and by 2024, we advanced to the top 10%. Furthermore, in 2024 we went from being amongst the top 22% of teams in Canada to being part of the top 11%.</p>
